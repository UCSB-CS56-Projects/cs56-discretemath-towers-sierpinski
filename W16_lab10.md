* Issue: Add the ability to change the number of disks in the Sierpinski's Triangle/ Towers of Hanoi display that you get with ant run from the GUI so you do not have to exit and re-enter the application. This should function similarly to how it does with the Pascal's triangle that you get from ant runPascal.

* Issue: Create a main entry page for the program so everything fits together better. This should function as something of a menu from which the user can navigate to all the current parts of the program and descriptions.

* Issue: Integrate the color picker as part of the swing GUI. Launch the color picker with the press of a button within the GUI, and when the color picker is closed, re-create the output xml file and re-display it.

*Issue: Currently, when the user runs "ant EX_DEF," a pop-up window will show. But if the user chooses the button "Choose New Scheme," a second pop-up window will show. If the user clicks on the "x" exit button on the pop-up, both pop-ups will close. Implement a 'back' button to revert back to the first pop-up window, as well as control the functionality of the 'x' exit button to do the same.
