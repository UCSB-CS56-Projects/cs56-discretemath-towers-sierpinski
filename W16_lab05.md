This project is meant to visually display the mathematical relationship between Pascal's Triangle, Sierpinski's Triangle, and the Towers of Hanoi.  


As a math teacher, I can create an image of Pascal's Triangle so that my students will see the relationship between Sierpinsky's Triangle and Pascal's Triangle.  

As a person interested in the Towers of Hanoi problem, I can generate an image of the possible moves so that I can see the relationship between the number of possible moves and the number of edges in Sierpinsky's Triangle.  

As a user, I can change the color scheme of the generated image so that it is more aesthetically pleasing.  

In its current state, this project runs. We are able to generate images of Pascal's and Sierpinsky's triangles and alter the color scheme. However, we have found difficulties displaying some of the user interfaces on OSX, which we will look into.

The current readme explains the purpose behind the program and gives instructions for using it. The information is provides is adequate. However, it is not organized in a coherent way and could be formatted better. The readme shows the overall project's lack of focus.

In the build.xml file, the compile and javadoc build targets lack descriptions. There are some internal targets that should have their descriptions removed so that the end user does not see them after running ant -p.

There are currently six issues open on the original repository, all of which are related to improving the currently lackluster GUI. They have clear expecations.
