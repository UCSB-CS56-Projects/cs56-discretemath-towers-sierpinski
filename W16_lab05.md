##a) brief description:
This project is meant to visually display the mathematical relationship between Pascal's Triangle, Sierpinski's Triangle, and the Towers of Hanoi.  

##b) user stories:
As a math teacher, I can create an image of Pascal's Triangle so that my students will see the relationship between Sierpinsky's Triangle and Pascal's Triangle. 

As a person interested in the Towers of Hanoi problem, I can generate an image of the possible moves so that I can see the relationship between the number of possible moves and the number of edges in Sierpinsky's Triangle.  

As a user, I can change the color scheme of the generated image so that it is more aesthetically pleasing.  

##c) Does the software run:
In its current state, this project runs. We are able to generate images of Pascal's and Sierpinsky's triangles and alter the color scheme. However, we have found difficulties displaying some of the user interfaces on OSX, which we will look into.

##c) new user stories:
As a user, I can change the number of rows displayed in the Pascal Triangle so I will be able to get a better understanding of how the Triangle works. 

As a user, I can open a general menu for the program so I don't have to run each program individually.

##d) README quality:
The current readme explains the purpose behind the program and gives instructions for using it. The information is provides is adequate. However, it is not organized in a coherent way and could be formatted better. The readme shows the overall project's lack of focus.

##e) build.xml file: 
In the build.xml file, the compile and javadoc build targets lack descriptions. There are some internal targets that should have their descriptions removed so that the end user does not see them after running ant -p.

##f) current issues:
There are currently six issues open on the original repository, all of which are related to improving the currently lackluster GUI. They are reasonably well defined if a little vague in that they basically state to "Fix the GUI".

##g) new issues:
https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-Projects/cs56-discretemath-towers-sierpinski/issues/40  
https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-Projects/cs56-discretemath-towers-sierpinski/issues/41  
https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-Projects/cs56-discretemath-towers-sierpinski/issues/42  

##h) code quality:
The current organization of the code is fairly reasonable given that the overall project lacks focus. The classes are well divided with each one having a reasonable goal. Each classes are fairly well organized for the most part, but some (particularly the Sierpinski Triangle portion) can be difficult to read and understand. A few other basic improvements could be made too:  

-The indentation of some of the code makes it hard to read at times  
-There are some places in which instance variables are capitalized which they should not be  
-Some lines of code go on for as much as 250 columns which they should not  
-Comments are a little excessive at times and javadoc comments are not all formatted well  

If we were to get another programmer up to speed on this project we would tell them that this repository has 3 separate programs: ColorPickerGUI, PascalTriangle, and Sierpinski Triangle. These programs are, though related in concept, completely independent of each other. They run as separate programs and an understanding of one of them is not required to help you understand any of the others. For the ColorPickerGUI and PascalTriangle programs, no knowledge of math is needed to make progress on this program. The pascal triangle is currently generated with hard coded values which could be improved. As is, the Pascal Triangle program simply displays a Pascal's Triangle with some squares a different color to illustrate a fractal designe. The ColorPickerGUI allows the user to choose, create, and save color schemes for the SierpinskiTriangle program. The color picker is currently a little hard to navigate, but it functions nonetheless. The Sierpinski Triangle program generates a triangle which displays the mathematical relationship between a triangle and the towers of hanoi problem in that each node displays a possible set of locations for the disks and taking a path through the edges of the triangles can represent a playing of the game. The actual code behind this is very GUI oriented (for example, the Pascal Triangle portion simply displays boxes with numbers in it) so you will notice very little separation between code that is meant to deal with graphics and back end code. 

##i) Test coverage:
There is absolutely no test coverage for this program. JUnit tests need to be added. This program may be difficult to run tests with as a large part of it is simply displaying content and GUI's are inherently difficult to test. However, the Sierpinski triangle in particular could benefit from some test cases to make sure it is generating the correct results. Also, once we make generating the Pascal triangle dynamic, it could benefit from some test cases as well.
